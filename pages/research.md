Our reseach interests span the area of defects in materials and their interactions within polycrystalline ensembles.

## 1. Building Defect-defect Interactions Genome
-----

Interactions between defects in materials can govern bulk thermodynamic and kinetic properties, especially in defect-densed materials subjected to large deformation of extreme environments such as radiation damage in nuclear applications. We aim to help build fundamental framework to create atomistic building blocks for materials system design framework and incorporate them with CALPHAD design approach for design of novel engineering materials.


## 2. Triple Junctions in Polycrystalline Materials
-----

Triple junction is predominant in polycrystalline materials and can act as mechanical constraints during deformation or transport pipeline during irradiation. We aim to build both fundamental framework and chemical database for studying thermodynamic and evolution of triple juctions which can control bulk properties through GB network engineering.
